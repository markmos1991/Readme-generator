  ## Description
  A command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

  ## Installation
  Download/clone the rrepository. In the command line npm install in order to run the package. You should be able to run the generator in the command line. When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.

  ## Usage
  The application then takes your responses and uses axios to fetch your GitHub profile from the GitHub API, including your GitHub profile picture (avatar) and email. From there, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts (so, if you don't answer the optional questions, such as Installation, an Installation section will not be included in your README). The README will also include badges for your GitHub repo.
